This is on of my first vanilla JavaScript project. It's Harry Potter themed.I used HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. I've made it at the beginning of my coding career . So it's not perfect.üòÅ But it's good :D I'm sorry 'cause I didn't put the files in separate folders. :D
<br>
Btw, it has a creepy sound track playing in the background, so I would recommend that you <b>lower down the volume</b> of your speakers, before opening the files! :D
